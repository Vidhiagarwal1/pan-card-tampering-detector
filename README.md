# pan-card-tampering-detector
A Python-based web application for detecting tampering or alterations in PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards using image processing techniques.
# Pan Card Tampering Detector App (With Deployment)

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Pan Card Tampering Detector App, which utilizes image processing techniques to detect any tampering or alterations in a PAN (Permanent Account Number) card. The application serves as a tool for verifying the authenticity of PAN cards, especially in scenarios where manual verification may be challenging or time-consuming.

## Features

1. **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of PAN cards through the application interface.
2. **Tampering Detection:** The application analyzes the uploaded images to identify any signs of tampering or alterations.
3. **Result Display:** Detected tampering or alterations are highlighted and displayed to the user for inspection.
4. **Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced image processing algorithms to ensure accurate tampering detection.
5. **Deployment:** The application is deployed to enable easy access and usage.

## Deployment

The Pan Card Tampering Detector App is deployed.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:** Click on the "Upload Image" button to select and upload an image of the PAN card.
2. **Tampering Detection:** The application will automatically analyze the uploaded image for any signs of tampering or alterations.
3. **View Results:** Detected tampering or alterations will be displayed on the screen, indicating the areas of concern.
4. **Verification:** Users can visually inspect the highlighted areas to verify the authenticity of the PAN card.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Flask
- **Image Processing Library:** OpenCV
- **Deployment Platform:** Heroku
